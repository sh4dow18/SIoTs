# Sh4dow's IoT Simulator (SIoTs)

# Overview

This guide teaches how to install Cisco Packet Tracer, as well as how to use IoT
components in a simulated environment where the elements act manually or
automatically so that the user understands how the world of the Internet of
Things works.

I will assume you have basic networking skills and will not explain things like
"IP", netmask or "DHCP".
